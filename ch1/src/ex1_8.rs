//! Exercise 1.8: Newtonâ€™s method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y
//! is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is
//! given by the value
//!
//! (x / y^2 + 2y) / 3
//!
//! Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the
//! square-root procedure.
